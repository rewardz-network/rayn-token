$RAYN Token Smart Contract

$RAYN is an ERC-20 token that serves as the primary currency within the R.A.Y.N. ecosystem, which includes our flagship game Runtz: Invasion. The $RAYN token functions as the ecosystem token and helps maintain economic stability within the system.
Furthermore, $RAYN tokens will be tradable on various exchanges. Holders truly own them, with neither the game developers nor any other party able to confiscate them without user consent or knowledge. This essential feature is made possible by the blockchain technology employed in both the game and the project's economy.
Playing Runtz and engaging with the community on social media platforms will allow users to earn $RAYN, a scarce and valuable currency whose worth increases as the platform attracts more users. In addition, users who wish to be part of the project without directly engaging in gaming sessions or tournaments can also earn rewards through gamification mechanics that encourage daily activity even for non-gamers.

All $RAYN holders will be able to utilize the staking system, become a member of the internal Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), and participate in voting.
